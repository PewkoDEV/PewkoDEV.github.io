      <h1>Pewko Studios</h1>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was a lone developer and a handful of unfinished ideas.
        Nights spent building worlds, not for an audience — but out of love for role-playing games.<p>
      </p>Pewko Studios began quietly, without promises or noise.<p>
        Just the belief that stories deserve time, and that games can still be made with care.</p>

      </p>Maybe the campfire will grow.
        Maybe more voices will join the tale.
        For now, the story is written slowly.</p>
        
      </p>Stay a while.
        It has only just begun.</p>

   <!-- WHO WE ARE -->

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      Pewko Studios takes its name from Pewko, my online alias.
      Behind that name, there is no team and no promise — just me.
      <br><br>
      I make games because I care about worlds, systems,
      and stories that take their time.
      Not to chase trends, not to make noise,
      but to build something coherent and sincere.
      <br><br>
      Pewko Studios was born from that simple desire:
      to make games with care, at my own pace,
      without unnecessary compromises.
      If others ever join the journey,
      it will be for the same reasons.
      For now, everything begins here.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        For now, Pewko Studios doesn’t show anything.  
        There’s no game ready to explore, just ideas that are slowly taking shape and mechanics I’m testing.  
        I’m still thinking about what the first game will be, but I already know it will be narrative, immersive, and crafted with care.  
        <br><br>
        I don’t want false hype or empty promises. Everything will come in time.
